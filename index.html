        <h1 id="stage0">Getting Started with HTML</h1>
      </div>
          <p>I have taken some previous courses regarding the basics of HTML but it was nice to see new tags that I have <b>not</b> seen before</p>

          <p>For example it was nice to see that <em>break</em> works just like <em>paragraph</em> but falls under an <b>inline</b> tag rather than a <b>block</b> tag that paragraph falls under.</p>

          <p>It was alos nice to see the difference between <b>span</b> and <b>div</b> tags as I've only seen in previous material but never defined. One of those courses was <a href="www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a>.
          </p>
      <div>
        <h2>Plans for this course</h2>
      </div>
          <p>I look forward to <em><b>learning</b></em> new material along 
          the way and see how far my potential <b>can</b> go!.</p>

        <h1 id="stage1">The Basics of the Web & Creating a Structured Document</h1>
      </div>
          <p>As I mentioned from my notes in Stage 0, most of the information has been a good review from what I've learned in the past. The most important thing that I took out of it that I never thought about before was picturing and breaking down websites into multiple boxes. Below is a <b>perfect</b> example of what was taught previously in 1.1 and 1.2</p>
          
          <img src="http://www.vanseodesign.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/struc3-column.png" alt="Box layout Example">
            
          <p>This sort of information will help me think about designing websites. This method will help me approach the larger parts of what is needed to be built first and work my way down to the smallest ones</p>
		  
		  <p>A very crucial piece and great habit programmers should develop early in their careers is making sure properly indent their code. When adding new elements to your code you should indent, or nest, the element further in. That way, if you need to fix an error or if someone else is reading your code, it'll be easier to read through and correct.</p>

        <h1 id="stage2">Adding CSS Style and HTML Structure</h1>
      </div>
          <p>There are a couple of important things to take away from Stage 1.3 which mainly involved CSS. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it helps us avoid <b><em>repetition</em></b> which will save a lot of time for larger websites (as well as headaches). For example, the CSS for this HTML has allowed me to easily make changes for all the separate sections of this page with a few rules as opposed to going through every section manually and adding the code.</p>
            
          <p>It's very important to keep things in order and pay close attention to detail because the most <b>specific</b> rules, or child elements, take priority over their parent element. One must know to keep their code organized and structured properly otherwise with one small typo, it can ruin your document completely. That's why incorporating CSS can save one the trouble of debugging their whole document line by line when they could have separated by sections.</p>
            
          <p>Here are some ways to add style to an HTML.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>For smaller projects you can add <em>style</em> with {} within the <b>head</b> tag</li>
              <li>Separate CSS file sheet. This is the most common method</li>
              <li>Write inline style to each and every code. Bad method and extremely repetitive.</li>
            </ul>
          
    
          <p>Remember to always <b><span class="refine">CODE, TEST, REFINE!</span></b></p>

         <h1 id="python1">Introduction to Serious Programming</h1>
       </div>
         <p>It's important to know and remember that Computer Science is about solving problems by breaking them into smaller pieces. Computers help us solve problems these problems as they are machines that can be programmed to run the complex programs which are a specific sequence of instructions that we, <b>the human</b>, input.</p>      
      
         <p>This has been my first real introduction to the programming language called Python. I have only used Ruby in the previous courses that I've taken but from this stage it is very similar.</p>
        
         <p>The Python grammar was useful in how to visually look at how Python breaks down, or <em>derivation</em> the inputs provided into the program. Getting some background information such as the <b>Backus-Naur Form</b> will really help me mentality as to what to expect the output/s should be.</p>
          
         <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Js1c4xC47wgMIx5tw978YTAewW-w7M_dDsJbP61xQ9FeZepRqmRd-HaUzKRUuOAWY6t0kT2ppy5QFPEe-g" alt="Python Grammar Example">
      
         <p> I've seen the Arithmetic Expressions broken down in Ruby and it follows the same concept so far for the mathematical expressions we practiced with.</p>
        
         <img src="http://people.cis.ksu.edu/~schmidt/505f10/bnffiles/expr1.jpg" alt="Python Ruby Expression">
      
         <p> Just like we learned in Stage 1, computers are <em>"stupid"</em> so we have to be very careful with making sure we type everything correctly as even missing a left or right parenthesis will output an error.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="sections">
        <div class="headings">
          <h1 id="python2">Variables and Strings</h1>
        </div>
          <p>In this section we learned a little bit more of the power of Python building off the grammar information we learned in 2.1. We were introduced to variables in Python, which are used to create a name and store, or <em>assign</em>, a value to that name. To <em>assign</em> a value in Python we use the " = " symbol between the name of the variable and what value we want to store to that name.</p>
      
		  <p>For example if we want to store <span class="box">28</span> to our variable <span class="box">"age"</span>, we would set it up as the follows: <span class="box">age (name of variable) = (the assignment) 28 (value)</span>. This is storing the value <span class="box">28</span> to <span class="box">"age"</span> which we can alter by adding or removing such as: <span class="box">new_age = age - 1</span>. This would take the current value of age, which is <span class="box">28</span>, and subtract <span class="box">1</span> to it thus creating and storing <span class="box">27</span> to our new variable called <span class="box">"new_age"</span>.</p>
          
          <p>The running topic is that computers are <em>stupid</em> and will output what we, the human, inputs. So in Python, <span class="box">2</span> is a number while <span class="box">"2"</span> is a string. So if we ran a code of <span class="box"> 2 + 2</span>, Python will give us <span class="box">4</span>. Whereas a code of <span class="box">"2" + "2"</span> will give us <span class="box">"22"</span>. So we have to be very careful of what we write in our code.</p>
      
          <p>So remember, variables can help in the following ways:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Improve code readability for users</li>
              <li>Offer a valuable way to store data</li>
              <li>Allow us a way to quickly change value, for example the "age" & "new_age" as stated above.</li>
            </ul>

          <h1 id="python3">Input -> Function -> Output</h1>
        </div>
            <p>In this lesson we learned about Functions, or "procedures", as Dave explained. Functions is something that takes an <b>input</b> and modifies its to produce and <b>output</b>. For example, we can create a function called <span class="box">"double"</span> that would take our input and modify it to take whatever input & <em>double</em> it giving us the appropriate <b>output</b>.<p>
            <p>We start creating functions with starting our line of code with the specific keyword <span class="box">def</span> and then giving it the name we desire and immediately follow that with <b>parameters</b> which are in parenthesis. Within these parameters will be the actual values when calling upon the function.
            
            <br>Inside of our function is the what we want our function to do to the values inside the parameters.      
              <br>For example, here is how the <span class="box">double</span> function would look like:</p>
            <div class="box-complete">def double(x):<br>
              <span class="box-indent"> answer = x * x<br></span>
              <span class="box-indent">return x</span>
            </div>
              <br>
              
            <p>To call that function, we simply type the name of the function followed by the value(s) we want to give in the parenthesis. For example:</p><br>
              <div class="box-complete">print square(10)<br>>>>>100</div><br>
              
            <p>Functions are very useful for programmers because in the long run once a function is define there is no need to keep retyping the information and it'll be as easy as just calling the function and inputting what you what! Imagine the amount of time one can save just by having all the proper foundation in place.</p>
    
            <p>It must be noted that the keyword <span class="box">return</span> must be within the function because it tells Python to produce an output. If there is not <span class="box">return</span> keyword within the function, Python will return <span class="box">none</span> as the <b>output</b>.</p>

          <h1 id="python4">Control Flow & Loops: If and While / Debugging</h1>
        </div>
            <p>This lesson brought a lot of new information that will be used a lot during our time learning programming, not only in Python but in future languages and code itself! We learned that <b>Boolean values</b> can either be <em>True</em> or <em>False</em> and were introduced to <em>If</em> and <em>While</em> Loops. The <em>If</em> loop takes a <em>Test Expression</em> and <b>if</b> the statement is <b>True</b>, then the block of code will execute. If not, it will jump to the next block of code which we can execute with the line of code <em>else</em>. Below is an example of a very basic <b>If</b> loop:</p>
            <br>
            <br>
              <div class="box-complete">def larger_number(a,b):<br>
                  <span class="box-indent"> if number a > b<br></span>
                  <span class="box-indent-2">return a<br></span>
                  <span class="box-indent">else:<br></span>
                  <span class="box-indent">return b<br></span>
              </div>
            <br>
            <p>The example above will return the value <b>a</b> <em>if</em> it was bigger than b. Otherwise, or <em>else</em>, it will return <b>b</b> <em>if</em> the value <b>b</b> was bigger than <b>a</b>. It's very important to note that we should remember to use <em>semicolon :</em> when writing our code as errors will come up if not entered at the appropriate locations.</p>
            <p>The <em>While</em> loop can keep running the same block of code while the test expression is <em>true</em>. Once the test expression is <em>false</em> it jumps to the next block of code and runs that. An example of the <em>While</em> loop is as follows:</p>
            <br>
              <div class="box-complete">def less_than_ten(a):<br>
                  <span class="box-indent"> i = 1 <br></span>
                  <span class="box-indent"> while i less than 10 <br></span>
                  <span class="box-indent-2">print i<br></span>
                  <span class="box-indent">i = i + a<br></span>                
              </div>
            <br>
            <p>This simple function will take whatever value you <b>input</b> to less_than_ten and <em>while</em> <b>i</b> is less than 10 it'll return the values. We can include the keyword <em>break</em> to jump out of a line of code but it's better practice not to include it unless we need to. Better to stick with the <em>else</em> method.</p>
            <p><em>"Bugs"</em> are errors in our code that simply don't work right. They can either be something as simple as a forgotten single quote, or even a parenthesis but it can cause huge headaches for programmers and user experience. The act of going through code and fixing any errors is know as <em>"debugging</em> and it's something that people can dedicate their whole time too! Software engineers make sure to avoid bugs at all cost! When we see an error within the Python shell it's useful to read what the <em>Traceback</em> reads because it tells you on what line the code is failing on.</p>
            <p>Here are some tips to follow on:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Examine error messages when programs crash</li>
                <li>Work from example code</li>
                <li>Make sure examples work</li>
                <li>Check (print) intermediate results</li>
                <li>Keep and compare old versions</li>

          <h1 id="python5">Structured Data: Lists and For Loops / How to Solve Problems</h1>
        </div>
          <p>For the final two sections of Stage 2 we came across new datatypes and some tips to solving problems for the future. The new data types that we came across were: <b><em>Lists</em></b> and <b><em>For Loops</em></b>. On a personal note, loops have been an issue for me since I was introduced to them when I was learning about <b>Ruby</b>. With that being said, <b><em>Lists</em></b> have been an easier transition with Python as <b>Lists</b>, to me, are like <b>Arrays</b> that I worked with in <b>Ruby</b>. <b>Lists</b> can have anything inside them, whether it's characters, strings, numbers, or even other lists!.</p>
        
          <p>Below is a very basic way to create a list.</p>
            <br>
              <div class="box-complete">list_example(this will be the name you give your list) = ['f', 'b', 'c', 'z']<br>
                  <span class="box-complete"> print list<br></span>                     
              </div>
            <br>
          
          <p>As we see above the list, <span class="box">list_example</span> contains the following elements: <span class="box">'f', 'b', 'c', 'z'</span>. For <b>lists</b> we can include strings <b>AND</b> numbers. We can also call upon elements within the <b>list</b> as so: <span class="box">list_example[0]</span>. This will call upon the first value, or as we know that <span class="box">[0]</span> is appropriate for calling the first value in Programming. With <b>lists</b> we can also put <b>lists</b> within <b>lists</b> and call index for certain elements. For example:</p>
            <br>
              <div class="box-complete">example_two = [['a', 'b', 'c', 1],['dog','cat','fish','toy']]<br>
                  <span class="box-complete"> print example_two[1][3]<br></span>                     
              </div>
            <br>
          
          <p>The <span class="box">example_two</span> will call the second <b>list</b> <span class="box">[1]</span> and the then select the 4th element <span class="box">[3]</span> and will return the value <span class="box">toy</span> to us!</p>
        
          <p>There are <b>two</b> main differences between <em>strings</em> and <em>lists</em> and they are:</p> 
             <ol>
               <li>Lists can hold anything within them</li>
               <li>Lists support <b><em>Mutation</em></b></li>
             </ol>
          
          <p><b><em>Mutation</em></b> allows us to change the value of a <b>list</b> even <em>after</em> we create it. For <span class="box">list_example</span> we can change the 3rd element by calling the <b>list</b> <span class="box">list_example[2]='d'</span> which will change, or <b><em>mutate</em></b>, the 3rd element thus giving us the updated list <span class="box"> list_example = ['a', 'b', 'd', 'z']</span>. It's also good to know that <b>numbers CAN NOT</b> be mutated. If we assign another variable to our <span class="box"> list_example</span> then we have two ways to call upon the same <b>list</b>, otherwise known as <b><em>aliasing</em></b>. When we have <em>aliasing</em> then we can change the element within the <b>list</b> and it'll change, or<em>mutate</em>, both of the lists! These changes will continue to occur until we assign one of the lists to another list.</p>
        
          <p>With <b><em>append</em></b> we can add <b>lists</b> to lists and increase to them. It would be done but adding the <em>.append</em> to the list as so:</p>
            <br>
              <div class="box-complete">list_example.append(example_two)<br>
                  <span class="box-complete"> print list_example<br></span>                     
              </div>
            <br>
          <p>After <b>appending</b> <span class="box">example_two</span> to <span class="box">list_example</span>, <span class="box">list_example</span> will become <span class="box"> list_example = ['f', 'b', 'd', 'z' ['a', 'b', 'c', 1],['dog','cat','fish','toy']]</span>. With the <b><em>len</em></b> operator, known as <em>length</em>, we can find out the length of <b>lists</b> and <b>strings</b>. We can find out the <b>length</b> of <span class="box">list_example</span> with the <span class="box">len(list_example)</span> and find out that there's only <em>3</em> elements. That's because we had <em>appended</em> the list <span class="box">example_two</span> to <span class="box">list_example</span> so being that <span class="box">example_two</span> was a <b>list</b> itself, the operator <b>len</b> counts that as <em>one</em> whole element and not multiple ones within it.</p>
        
          <p>The <b><em>For Loop</em></b> allows us to loop through elements within a list. The setup and result in this example is as following:</p>
            <br>
              <div class="box-complete">numbers = [1, 2, 3]<br>
                  <span class="box-complete"> for e in numbers:<br></span>
                  <br>
                  <span class="box-complete"> print e<br></span> 
              </div>
            <br>
          <p>As we see above, the <span class="box"> for e in numbers: </span> or <em>for the elements in numbers</em> print <b>e</b> or the elements. This will give the results as:</p>
            <br>
              <div class="box-complete">1<br>
                  <span class="box-complete">2<br></span>
                  <br>
                  <span class="box-complete">3<br></span> 
              </div>
            <br>
          <p>We can also directly check and see if values are in <b>lists</b> with the <b><em>in</em></b> opeartor and <em>where</em> values are in with the <b><em>index</em></b> operator. <span class="box"> 2 in numbers</span> will return <em>True</em> and <span class="box">numbers.index(2)</span> will tell <em>where</em> the value is located, which in this case is <span class="box">1</span> since we beginning counting at 0.</p>
        
          <p>Finally it's good to work up the skill of being able to <em>solve a problem</em> because chances are that we'll come up some really hard questions (for now its for loops for me). It's ok to take a step back and evaluate where we are but the most important rule Dave taught us was <b>DONT PANIC!</b></p>
        
          <p>Here is a list how to solve a problem and should come handy down the road.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>What are the inputs?</li>
              <li>What are the outputs?</li>
              <li>Solve the problem!</li>
              <li>Simple mechanical solution</li>
              <li>Developing incrementally and test as we go</li>
            </ol>
          <p>It's also good to write small bits of code as we go along to see if things are functioning how we expect them to. Easier to break down a problem into smaller chunks instead of going head on full steam. Sometimes it's best to <em>slow down</em>.</p>
